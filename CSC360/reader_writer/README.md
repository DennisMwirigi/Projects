For task 1:
By using semaphores I did my best to implement the assignment descriptioon. When the read is called it first waits to check to see if there are any writers writing,
if not then the read is performed however if there are then the write is performed first then the read afterwards.

For task 2:
Through the use of mutexes and condition variables I tried to implement what was provided in the assignment description.
