CSC 360 Asssignment 1

In part A and B I was able to:
 - Repeatedly prompt the user for commands
 - Print errors to stdout where they occurred and in very few cases, terminate the program upon an error
 - Correctly parse the .sh360rc file
 - Execute user input as child processes
 - Terminate the program upon receiving "exit" as an input

In part C I was able to:
 - Recognize that the user input is geared towards writing stdout to a file
 - Correctly parse the user input
 - CReate child processes that emulate writing of stdout to a file

In part D I was able to:
 - Recognize that the user input is geared towards writing stdout to a file
 - Correctly parse the user input, for the most part. I was able to store the paths of the given commands
   in an array. I was also able to store a command's associated arguments in a 3d array however when it came to
   accessing this array so as to create cmd_head and tail correctly I was overwhelmed and this is where I not able
   get past.
