# Projects
This repository will contain a mix of assignments I have done during the period of my undergraduate degree and personal projects that I have done in my own time
however currently it only contains a few assignments.

I have chosen not to alter any of the files from the assignment projects so you will definitely encounter some badly written markdown files among other things. 
Also, if I was not able to complete a certain component of the assignment at the time then that is how it will also appear here.

### CSC 360 UNIX Shell
In this project we were meant to design and implement a simple, interactive shell program that would be able to provide the following basic features:
* Repeatedly prompt the user for commands and execute those commands up until the terminating "exit" command is input
* Execute simple commands with at most 7 arguments
* Perform command-line Redirection
* Perform command-line Piping

### SENG 265 Key Word Out of Context
In this project we created a concordance program that would indicate in which line of a text file that key words occur and whether or not said key words appear more 
than once in the same line (denoted by an asterix *).

In order to generate key words, there exists exception files (in english, deutsch and latin) which contain words that are not to be considered key words; typically 
words that are used very often such as "the", "or" and many more.

### CSC 361 Datagram Analyzer
In this project we developed a network protocol analyzer similar to Wireshark. We were however constrained to analyze the ICMP and UDP packets.
